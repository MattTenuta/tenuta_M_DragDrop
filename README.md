# Drag & Drop Homework

This file is a drag and drop puzzle

It was made using html, css, and javascript

## Installation

You dont need to download anything to run the puzzle, just open the index.html

## Problems

Unfortunately, the puzzle does not work as intended, but you can still play it and then refresh the page to try again.

I was unable to fix the reseting pieces problem and the stacking problem.
